Here we present a scenario which forms a basis for a discussion on machine learning. Please read the scenario and consider the questions listed. There is no need for a fancy presentation, just come prepared to discuss the scenario and expect additional questions on the topic

# Description

Consider working in a hospital that is keeping track of a virus's spread (for example: COVID 19) in the community. Hundreds of thousands of people can contribute their body temperature data thanks to a smartwatch application developed by the hospital.

> Note: Aside from that, the hospital also collects other heterogeneous data fields such as age, gender, location, glucose level, heart-rate, blood oxygen level, confirmed cases (person is covid positive or not).

# Questions

- What is the most efficient approach to analyzing the data?
- How would you formulate the problem?
- Which model would you use as a starting point from a broad variety of machine learning algorithms accessible today? 
- What are the most likely constraints you'd have to deal with and how to mitigate the challenges?
